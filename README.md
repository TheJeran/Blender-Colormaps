This is an addon to quickly and efficiently load colormaps into the colorramp node in Blender

## Installation
Simply install the .zip from this repository in Blender. After activating the addon you will be notified if you need to install some dependencies.

Currently there are three color libraries: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html), [Colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/user_guide/index.html), and [Cmocean](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/)
Please create an issue if you know of a good library that's easy to implement.

You can update ColorRamp nodes when one is selected

Gamma-correction ensures that colors in Blender are perceived the same way as in matplotlib

**note:** The Color Maps dropdown will be blank immediately after install. Simply re-select/choose another color library to repopulate it. This is a quirk that only occurs after install
